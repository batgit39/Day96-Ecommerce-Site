# Day96-Ecommerce-Site
A basic eCommerce site made with python and bootstrap and stripe,

This can be used by anyone with some basic moditicatins on the database. 

For frontend I used flask and html, css and bootstrap. And for checkout the stripe api.

The database is handled by SQLAlchemy


I made it in Dark and Light Mode:
